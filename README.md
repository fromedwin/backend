## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ (tested with 3.14)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fromedwin/monitor.git
   cd monitor
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv apps
   source apps/bin/activate
   pip install -r src/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   ./fromedwin start
   ```
   
   The script will automatically create a `.env` file with default values if one doesn't exist. You can customize the environment variables in the `.env` file as needed.
   
   Or alternatively:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:8000
   ```

That's it! Your monitoring system is now running locally.

## API authentication

The REST API at `/api/v1/` accepts **ShellUI JWT tokens only** (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Tokens are issued by the ShellUI identity service (default: [id.shellui.com](https://id.shellui.com)).

Configure these environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SHELLUI_JWT_ORIGIN` | Identity service URL (default: `https://id.shellui.com`; JWKS at `{origin}/.well-known/jwks.json`) |
| `SHELLUI_JWT_ALGORITHMS` | Allowed JWT algorithms for JWKS verification (default: `RS256,ES256,EdDSA`) |
| `SHELLUI_JWT_SECRET` | Optional legacy HS256 shared secret (only needed if not using JWKS) |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated web app origins allowed to call the API |

The [web app](../webapp/) sends the ShellUI `accessToken` to the backend. Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in the web app to point at this server (`http://localhost:8000` in development, `https://fromedwin.com` in production).

## 🐳 Docker Management

The project includes a convenient script (`fromedwin`) to manage Docker services:

### Start Services
```bash
./fromedwin start
```
This starts all Docker services (database, monitoring, worker, and main services) in detached mode.

### Stop Services
```bash
./fromedwin stop
```
This stops all Docker services and cleans up containers.
